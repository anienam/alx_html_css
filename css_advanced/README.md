# Advanced HTML & CSS Styling Project

This project is a continuation of the **HTML Advanced** module, focused on transforming a raw HTML structure into a fully styled, responsive, and visually accurate webpage using CSS based on a provided Figma design.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build on the previously completed **Advanced HTML** project.
- Apply modern, clean, well-structured **CSS styling** to match the Figma design.
- Ensure the page is responsive, accessible, and visually consistent with the designer’s layout.

## 🎨 Figma Design

Access the final design here:

- **Figma Page:** (https://www.figma.com/design/RAjqTKKdeMgj3J0j5rAFhu/Homepage-ALX-Design?node-id=0-1&t=DRB8cppniWIS45kR-1)

To work with the design:

- Log in to Figma and **Duplicate to your Drafts** to inspect dimensions, spacing, fonts, and colors.
- If your computer doesn’t have the required fonts, download them:

  - **Source Sans Pro**
  - **Spin Cycle OT**

- Some Figma values may be floats—feel free to round them to practical CSS values.

## 📁 Assets

All project images are provided in the images folder

Make sure to add the images into your project and update the HTML where necessary (e.g., logo paths).

## 🧩 Project Requirements

- Use the starter HTML from the **HTML Advanced** concept page.
- Create an `index.html` file and make any relevant changes needed (image tags, alt text, logos, etc).
- Add your CSS styles in a separate stylesheet.
- No inline CSS.
- Match the Figma layout as closely as possible.
- Ensure full responsiveness and clean code structure.

## 🖥️ How to Run

Just open **index.html** in your browser—no server setup needed.

## 📝 Notes

- Maintain semantic HTML structure.
- Use Flexbox or Grid where appropriate.
- Keep your CSS organized and readable.
- Pixel-perfect accuracy is encouraged but not mandatory.
